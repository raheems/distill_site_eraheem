R being my primary tool for most of data science work, I got carried away and made some silly errors when I presented the data summary. The issue I fould later was due to how SAS handles missing values differently than R. R’s handling of NA or missing value is quite intuitive that it will ignore the values with NA silently in most functions. So unless you care about counting the missing cases for reporting purposes, R silently excludes missing.\n\nHowever, SAS treats missing values as the smallest value in the colum, and does not ignore it.\n\nThis is crucial. I will demonstrate how crucial it is and how it will affect your analysis.\nR and SAS handle missing values differently\nWill be best if I show you an example.\nLet’s create a fake data set.\n\n\ndf = data.frame(name= c(\"John\", \"Rumi\", \"Samia\"),\n                age = c(30, 20, NA))\ndf\n\n\n   name age\n1  John  30\n2  Rumi  20\n3 Samia  NA\n\nLet’s create a new variable based on condition unavailable that has a missing value.\n\n\ndf %>% \n  mutate(\n    age_under_20_flag = case_when(\n      age <= 20 ~ 1,\n      TRUE ~ 0\n    ),\n    \n    age_under_20_flag_ifelse = if_else(age <= 20, 1, 0)\n  )\n\n\n   name age age_under_20_flag age_under_20_flag_ifelse\n1  John  30                 0                        0\n2  Rumi  20                 1                        1\n3 Samia  NA                 0                       NA\n\nLet’s see how it does and SAS.\n/* test data set to demonstrate how SAS handles missing values */\n\ndata df;\ninput name $ age;\ncards;\nJohn 30\nRumi 20\nSamia .\n;\nrun;\n\nNow lets create the same flag if age equal or below 20\ndata df2;\n  set df;\n  if age <= 20 then age_under_20_flag = 1;\n  else age_under_20_flag = 0;\nrun;\n\nNow notice how SAS handled the missing value. SAS considers missing value as the smallest value in your column. Thus you really have to handle missing value separately, in this case, prior to applying the if\n\nHow R handles NA\nHow SAS handles NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
